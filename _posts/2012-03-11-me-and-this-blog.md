title: Me and this blog
---

I am a Microsoft employee in a product group. Currently I am working on private cloud automation and integration.
Some time ago, I created a blog on MSDN http://blogs.msdn.com/b/yao/ with the name ["Yao’s Whiteboard"](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/yao/). The MSDN
blog is primarily for supporting my team’s product, which is System Center Orchestrator 2012 at the moment. For my
personal thoughts and perspectives, I put it at this place. Note that the opinions expressed on this blog are my
own and do not represent the point of view of my current or past employer. These posts are provided "as-is" with no
